# Atomic Level Interactions, Friction and Skip-Slide Motion Simulation

This code aims to study skip-slide motion for atoms dor specific conditions and also aims to understand energy loss caused by friction and other effects.

## Constants and Predefined Parameters

This simulation analyzes nickel atoms which consists of 1001 1D layer of connected Ni atoms and a moving Ni atom which is traveling above those atoms.

## Output

Output is .xyz file which contains the whole motion.
